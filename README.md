# Scala Exercises
### This is a repository dedicated to Scala exercises for graphs.

### The package object utils contains code that checks whether a graph defined by a list of vertices (integers) and a list of edges (pairs of integers) is a tree.
### See the function
`def isTree(vert: List[Int], edges: List[Tuple_Int_Int]):Boolean`

### The implementation consists in
* Detecting cycles 
* Checking for connectivity.
